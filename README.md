# Professional Portfolio
  
## An employer wanted to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples so they can review samples of their work and assess whether they are a good candidate for an open position. In this project, I need to create a professional portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs. In specific, my portfolio needed to include the following criteria: 
  1. Portfolio must include developer's name, recent photo, links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
  2. Links in the navigation that will automatically scroll to the respective sections when clicked
  3. The work section includes titled images of the developer's applications
  4. The first image representing the developer's first application must be larger in size than the other images
  5. The images in the work section must lead to the deployed application when clicked
  6. When resizing the page, the layout must adapt to the viewport


The following screenshots display the portfolio in a 768x814px (tablet) viewport.
